REGULAR_EXPRESSIONS.tooltip=Add custom regular expressions. If this is not empty, override default behaviour and use these instead. Syntax is similar to the sed UNIX utility, but only for replacements. The regex used to match this is as follows: s(.)(?<pattern>.*?[^\\])\1(?<replace>.*)\1(?<flags>\w*) For example, you may use "s/Iron/Lead/g" to replace all occurrences of "Iron" with "Lead"
STUTTER.tooltip=How often should there be stuttering?
owo.tooltip=What's this?
